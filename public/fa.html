<h3>Biryani</h3>
<P>Affordability and hassle-free preparation
    A one-pot meal, no side dish needed
    Reminds us of our childhood memories
    Perfect for singles and terrible cooks
    Biryani lovers can relate to the following2:
    If they don’t love biryani, then they definitely CANNOT be your friends
    There’s no greater joy than waking up to the smells of biryani-in-the-making
    You judge a restaurant by how well they prepare their biryani
    And you never go to one if they don’t have the dish on their men</P>
<h3>chicken rice</h3>    
<P>There are countless reasons to love chicken rice,
     making it a beloved dish enjoyed by people around
